# AMS595 Project 2
This MATLAB project detects and analyzes the upper boundary of the Mandelbrot set. It includes four sections:

Section 1: Samples the complex plane vertically and detects boundary points using a bisection method.

Section 2: Filters outliers and selects a contiguous region of boundary points for analysis.

Section 3: Fits a 15th-order polynomial to the selected boundary points.

Section 4: Calculates the arc length of the fitted boundary and plots the detected points with the polynomial fit.
