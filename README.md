# AMS595 Project 1

This MATLAB project estimates the value of π using Monte Carlo methods. It includes three parts:

Part 1: Estimates π for a range of sample sizes and plots convergence, error, and runtime.

Part 2: Determines how many random points are required to achieve a specified decimal precision of π.

Part 3: Interactive version with a live plot of random points in a quarter circle until the desired precision is reached.
