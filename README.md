# AMS595 Project 5
This repository contains the Python code for Project 5:

1. PageRank Algorithm:
  Computes the dominant eigenvector of a stochastic matrix
  Implements iterative PageRank until convergence
  Normalizes and interprets page rankings

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   Loads standardized height–weight data
   Computes the covariance matrix and performs eigenvalue decomposition
   Projects data onto the first principal component
   Includes visualizations

3. Linear Regression via Least Squares
   Builds a least-squares regression model for housing data
   Predicts prices using matrix computations
   Compares least-squares and direct normal-equation solutions

4. Gradient Descent for MSE Minimization
   Defines and minimizes a mean squared error loss function
   Implements both SciPy optimization and manual gradient descent
   Includes a plot of loss over iterations
