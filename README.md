# AMS595 Project 4
This repository contains solutions to Python Assignment 1 for AMS 595.

This project focused on three computational methods that demonstrate fundamental principles in numerical analysis, stochastic processes, and mathematical approximation. The first part involved generating the Mandelbrot set through iterative complex number calculations, illustrating fractal geometry and boundedness. The second part applied Markov chain theory to model probabilistic transitions and identify steady-state behavior. The third part implemented a Taylor series approximation to represent analytic functions symbolically and evaluate convergence. Together, these sections explored key mathematical ideas related to iteration, stability, and approximation.
